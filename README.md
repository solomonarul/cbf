# CBF

CBF is a module for the [edra](https://github.com/solomonarul/edra) emulator, designed with simplicity and agnosticism first.

That means that it is incredibly simple to run it on your own by just creating your own Brainfuck context, the library just provides the building blocks for you to play around with.

### Examples:

- For a minimal sample, check out the [benchmarks](./bench/).
- Also check out [edra](https://github.com/solomonarul/edra)'s usage [here.](https://github.com/solomonarul/edra/blob/main/inc/drivers/bf.h)
